                What did that mean for all the beautiful AngularJS apps out
                there? They are now legacy.

              <li>
                AngularJS would continue to receive some updates but cease being

                Where I was working at the time I had a sweet setup with

                TRANSITION: This is where we were at when I joined Dina in 2022.

                This talk is about how we finally migrated off of AngularJS onto
                React. The actual React part isn't as crucial. Even if you're
                dealing with legacy software not on the front-end. I hope this
                talk is beneficial or inspiring to you in some way.

                Before we get too far, we need to establish why migrate off of
                legacy tech at all?
              </li>
              <li>
                At Dina, we theoretically could've stayed on AngularJS forever
              </li>
              <li>
                Aside from the possible security and business continuity
                reasons, this is my main motivation
              </li>
              <li>Working with legacy tech means having an inferior product</li>
              <li>
                The mental model I have for that is: UX is downstream of DX
              </li>
              <li>
                We as developers are craftsman, and if our tools are old, dull,
                and rusty - how can we create beautiful products?
              </li>
              <li>
                The frustration, slow build times, hunting around for bugs in
                abandoned libraries all takes mental power away from innovation,
                and really caring about the quality of the product, because as a
                developer, I'm just fighting getting basic things to work
                consistently

                A frustrated engineer will create a product that frustrates
                users
              </li>
              <li>
                On the other hand, a happy engineer with fast feedback loops can
                create a beautiful product

                The first thing that gets in the way are bug fixes. You simply

                The second obstacle is "high priority features". Whether they

            <li>So, often times we try to separate our teams</li>
            <li>
              Often times, the senior engineers and architects build the new
              version while the juniors are left to maintain the old.
            </li>
            <li>Make sense to some degree. Forging new paths is tricky work</li>
            <li>
              Leads to context switching for the senior engineers to help out

            <li>
              Leads to alienation for the junior engineers. Who wants to be
              stuck maintaining a legacy app? Is there anything more fun or
              exciting as an engineer than a greenfield project?
            </li>
            <li>
              Another thing that is often tried is to have a new team build the

                    The tendency for the rewrite to become an over-engineered

                  <li>
                    We tend to let scope creep take over and continue to rewrite

                The "app shell" are shared components that are imported and
                independently packaged into each microfrontend
              </li>
              <li>
                There's an obvious tradeoff to this approach vs iframes or
                monolith where if we change any of these shared components, we
                need to redeploy all of our apps.
              </li>
              <li>
                This can be mitigated by only sharing what is absolutely

                Nx has many great features, but the one I want to focus on here
                is Task Pipelines

              <li>
                This diagram shows our Inbox app and how it depends on other
                modules in our repo
              </li>
              <li>
                Without Nx, if I wanted to build, serve, or test the Inbox app,
                I would first need to manually build the modules it depends on
              </li>
              <li>
                Nx can do this for me automatically, AND it can cache modules
                that haven't changed
              </li>
              <li>
                This means I can be working on a specific feature in the Inbox
                app and enjoy quick build times and feedback loops
              </li>
              <li>
                Additionally, I can ask Nx to only build or test the apps that
                were affected with Nx affected
              </li>
              <li>
                This all mitigates the long build times that's a common downside
                of monorepos
